# US Output Gap Forecast

## Contributor
Keita Miyaki

## Goal
This project aims to develop a model to accurately forecast GDP gap of the US economy using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Data
Macroeconomic and financial data from FRED since kate 1970's, up/downsampled to weekly frequency for data not in weekly frequency.

## Current status
Recurrent neural network model was developed and is being tuned. It overfits and also predictions fluctuate, so those issues should be addressed.

Initially I thought increasing epochs would help to manage fluctuations but it hasn't worked well so far. Increasing drop-out rate might address overfitting? Or is this an impossible mission?

## Current code

I'm using 52 timesteps (i.e. one year). Data is processed through PCA (30 top principal components are used). Train data shape is (1469, 52, 30).

```
        regressor = Sequential()

        regressor.add(LSTM(units = 50, return_sequences = True, input_shape = (X_train_rnn.shape[1], X_train_rnn.shape[2])))
        regressor.add(Dropout(drop_out))

        regressor.add(LSTM(units = 50, return_sequences = True))
        regressor.add(Dropout(drop_out))

        regressor.add(LSTM(units = 50, return_sequences = True))
        regressor.add(Dropout(drop_out))

        regressor.add(LSTM(units = 50))
        regressor.add(Dropout(drop_out))

        regressor.add(Dense(units = 1))

        regressor.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'mean_squared_error')

        regressor.fit(X_train_g_rnn, 
                  y_train_g_rnn, 
                  epochs=50, 
                  batch_size=32)
```
